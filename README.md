# Back-propagating reward signals in model-based Reinforcement Learning.

## Abstract
This research project aims to enhance sample efficiency and stability in model-based reinforcement learning. The core idea of this method is to back-propagate actual reward signals from the environment instead of relying on a reward function approximator. To that end, a forward predictive model is utilized for the planning task, while a backward model is responsible for value expansion.
